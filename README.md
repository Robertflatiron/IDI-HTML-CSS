# IDI-HTML-CSS
Hello and welcome to Ideal Diagnostic Imaging (IDI). IDI is a medical diagnostic company which provides medical imaging for patients to help in diagnosing their injuries. Using medical imaging such as MRI, CT, X-ray and Ultrasound can provide a treating Physician a virtual look into their images and will allow them to provide the right steps for their patient to heal their given injury. 

In this example website, I will be using HTML and CSS to create a website a company such as this might be able to use. This will also be used to showcase my knowledge in them both. 

Thank you,
